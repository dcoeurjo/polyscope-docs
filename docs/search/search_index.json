The lofty objective of Polyscope is to offer a useful visual interface to your data via a single line of code. Polyscope uses a paradigm of structures and quantities . A structure is a geometric object in the scene, such as a surface mesh or point cloud. A quantity is data associated with a structure, such as a scalar function or a vector field. When any of these structures and quantities are registered, Polyscope displays them in an interactive 3D scene, handling boilerplate concerns such as toggling the display of various data, colormapping data and editing maps, providing \u201cpicking\u201d support to click in the scene and display numerical quantities, and generating histograms of scalar values. A simple workflow for visualizing data in Polyscope looks like: #include \"polyscope/polyscope.h\" #include \"polyscope/surface_mesh.h\" // Initialize polyscope polyscope :: init (); // Register a surface mesh structure polyscope :: registerSurfaceMesh ( \"my mesh\" , mesh . vertices , mesh . faces ); // Add a scalar and a vector function to the mesh polyscope :: getSurfaceMesh ( \"my mesh\" ) -> addVertexScalarQuantity ( \"my_scalar\" , scalarQuantity ); polyscope :: getSurfaceMesh ( \"my mesh\" ) -> addFaceVectorQuantity ( \"my_vector\" , vectorQuantity ); // Show the gui polyscope :: show (); Polyscope is designed to be easy to integrate with existing programs. It is simple to build, and fewer than 10 lines of code should be sufficient to start visualizing. Thanks to some template magic , Polyscope can probably directly read from the data types you\u2019re already using!

But there\u2019s a problem, because different codebases uses different C++ types to store their data: is an array of scalars a std :: vector < double > or an Eigen :: VectorXf or some other internal type? Codebases for 3D geometry are particularly guilty of this: there are probably several hundred distinct 3D vector x-y-z classes floating around github. Rather than forcing the user to manually convert their data types to some Polyscope types, we implement a series of templated adaptor functions, which attempt to read from the user types via a common set of strategies. These adaptors are applied to the inputs to nearly all Polyscope functions, allowing them to automatically accept user-defined types as inputs. You don\u2019t need to do anything special to use these adaptors! They are applied internally to the arguments of nearly every Polyscope function, like the vertices and faces arguments of registerSurfaceMesh ( \"name\" , vertices , faces ) . This section outlines how the adaptors will try to read from your data, and how to extend them for unusual datatypes which are not automatically handled. These functions live in # include \" polyscope/standardize_data_array.h \" . It\u2019s fairly well-commented\u2014 check it out to see how all this works under the hood! Fixed size vector types These are 2D or 3D vectors whose size are known at compile time, commonly used to represent things like positions (3D), or UV coordinates (2D). Examples of 3D vector types that Polyscope can read from out of the box include glm :: vec3 , Eigen :: Vector3d , and std :: array < double , 3 > (likewise for 2D). Hierarchy Polyscope will attempt to access an input 2D vector in the following ways, in order of decreasing precedence: any user-defined function (see below) bracketed indices (like vec [ 0 ] and vec [ 1 ] ) members x , y (like vec . x and vec . y ) members u , v (like vec . u and vec . v ) members functions real () / imag () (like vec . real () and vec . imag () ) Polyscope will attempt to access an input 3D vector in the following ways, in order of decreasing precedence: any user-defined function (see below) bracketed indices (like vec [ 0 ] , vec [ 1 ] , and vec [ 2 ] ) members x , y , z (like vec . x , vec . y , and vec . z ) using Eigen fixed-size vectorizable types If you are using fixed-sized, vectorizable Eigen types like Eigen :: Vector2f and Eigen :: Vector4f as your 2D/3D vector types, there are special, tricky alignment rules imposed by Eigen which must be respected. For instance, a std :: vector < Eigen :: Vector2f > is not a valid type; using it will lead to tricky-to-debug segfaults. Polyscope makes a best effort to avoid problems when the caller\u2019s fixed vector type has alignment constraints, but beware\u2014these are dangerous waters. See Eigen\u2019s documentation here and here for more information. extending vector access Extending Suppose you have an in-house vector type which cannot be accessed by any strategy in the hierarchy above. You can define a custom function that accesses the elements of your type: YOUR_TYPES_SCALAR adaptorF_custom_accessVector2Value ( const YOUR_TYPE & v , unsigned int ind ); The array adaptors will pick up this function and use it to access your type. Example: // A vector2 type with unusual access struct UserVector2Custom { double foo ; double bar ; }; // Define an accessor to teach Polyscope to read from your type double adaptorF_custom_accessVector2Value ( const UserVector2Custom & v , unsigned int ind ) { if ( ind == 0 ) return v . foo ; if ( ind == 1 ) return v . bar ; throw std :: logic_error ( \"bad access\" ); return - 1. ; } // Now Polyscope functions can take this type as input! The same principle applies for 3D vectors, where the relevant function is named YOUR_TYPES_SCALAR adaptorF_custom_accessVector3Value ( const YOUR_TYPE & v , unsigned int ind ); Array size The three array adaptor variants below (scalar array, vector array, and nested array) all assume the ability to read the size of an input array. Hierarchy Polyscope will attempt to read the length of an input array in the following ways, in decreasing order of precedence: any user-defined function (see below) a .rows () member function (like inputData . rows () ) a .size () member function (like inputData . size () ) extending array size Extending Suppose you have an in-house array type whose length cannot be read by any strategy in the hierarchy above. You can define a custom function that reads the length like: size_t adaptorF_custom_size ( const YOUR_ARRAY_TYPE & c ); The array adaptors will pick up this function and use it to access your type. Example: // Array with custom length function called \"bigness()\" struct UserArray { std :: vector < double > myData ; size_t bigness () const { return myData . size (); } }; // Size function for custom array size_t adaptorF_custom_size ( const UserArray & c ) { return c . bigness (); } Scalar arrays A scalar array is a long list of values, like a float at each point in a point cloud, or an int at each vertex of a mesh. We will use the type S to refer to the inner scalar type of an array, like float in std :: vector < float > . Examples of scalar arrays that Polyscope can read from out of the box include std :: vector < float > , Eigen :: VectorXd , and std :: list < int > . Hierarchy Polyscope will attempt to access an input scalar array in the following ways, in order of decreasing precedence: any user-defined function (see below) bracketed index access (like array [ i ] ) parenthesis index access (like array ( i ) ) for-each iteration (like array . begin () , array . end () ) extending scalar array access Extending Suppose you have an in-house array type whose elements cannot be accessed by any strategy in the hierarchy above. You can define a custom function that converts your arrays to a std :: vector < S > like std :: vector < YOUR_SCALAR_TYPE > adaptorF_custom_convertToStdVector ( const YOUR_ARRAY_TYPE & c ) { The array adaptors will pick up this function and use it to access your type. Example: // User array with unusual access struct UserArrayFuncAccess { std :: vector < double > myData ; size_t size () const { return myData . size (); } }; std :: vector < double > adaptorF_custom_convertToStdVector ( const UserArrayFuncAccess & c ) { std :: vector < double > out ; for ( auto x : c . myData ) { out . push_back ( x ); } return out ; } Arrays of vectors These are arrays of values where each element of the array is itself a fixed-size vector type, like the 3D position of each point in a point cloud, or a list of edges in a graph. Note that these arrays must have an inner dimension which is fixed and known at compile time. Examples of vector arrays that Polyscope can read from out of the box include std :: vector < glm :: vec3 > , Eigen :: Matrx < N , 3 > , and std :: list < std :: array < int , 2 >> . Hierarchy Polyscope will attempt to access an input array of vectors in the following ways, in order of decreasing precedence: any user-defined function (see below) dense parenthesis access (like array ( i , j ) ) double bracket access (like array [ i ][ j ] ) outer type bracket-accessible, inner type anything convertible to Vector2/3 (like array [ i ] . x ) outer type iterable, inner type anything convertible to Vector2/3 (like for ( auto vec : array ) and vec . u ). outer type iterable, inner type bracket-accessible (like for ( auto vec : array ) and vec [ 7 ] ) Notice that two these options make use of the fixed-sized vector adaptors . Once Polyscope can read the elements of SOME_VEC3_TYPE , it can also read from std :: vector < SOME_VEC3_TYPE > , etc. The sizes of the inner vector type are generally not checked by Polyscope, so be sure you\u2019re passing in something with the right dimensions! If a function expects an array of 3D vectors, don\u2019t give it an array of 2D vectors. extending array-of-vectors access Extending Suppose you have an in-house array-of-vectors type whose elements cannot be accessed by any strategy in the hierarchy above. You can define a custom function that converts your arrays to a std :: vector < S > like std :: vector < std :: array < SCALAR_T , N >> adaptorF_custom_convertArrayOfVectorToStdVector ( const YOUR_ARRAY_TYPE & c ) The array adaptors will pick up this function and use it to access your type. Really, the return type of this method can anything that supports .size () and bracket access; std :: vector < std :: vector <>> would also work. The size of the inner vector is not checked, so be sure it\u2019s right! Example: // An array of vectors with an unusual access scheme struct UserArrayVectorCustom { std :: list < SOME_TYPE > vals ; size_t size () const { return vals . size (); } }; // Define a custom access function std :: vector < std :: array < double , 3 >> adaptorF_custom_convertArrayOfVectorToStdVector ( const UserArrayVectorCustom & inputData ) { std :: vector < std :: array < double , 3 >> out ; for ( auto v : inputData . vals ) { out . push_back ({ v . x (), v . y (), v . z ()}); } return out ; } Nested arrays These are arrays-of-arrays, like the list of vertex indices for each face in a polygon mesh. Unlike the arrays-of-vectors above, the dimensions of the inner arrays need not be known at compile time, and can vary (though arrays with fixed-sized inner dimension are also valid input). Examples of vector arrays that Polyscope can read from out of the box include std :: vector < std :: vector < int >> , Eigen :: Matrix < double , N , 3 > , and std :: vector < std :: list < size_t >> . Hierarchy Polyscope will attempt to access a nested array in the following ways, in order of decreasing precedence: any user defined function dense callable (parenthesis) access on a type that supports array . rows () and array . cols () (like array ( i , j ) ). outer type bracket-accessible, inner type anything that can be accessed as a scalar array (like array [ i ][ j ] ) outer type parenthesis-accessible, inner type anything that can be accessed as a scalar array (like array ( j ) [ i ] ) outer type iterable, inner type anything that can be accessed as a scalar array (like for ( auto inner : array ) and inner [ 7 ] ). Notice that several of these options make use of the scalar array adaptors . Once Polyscope can read from YOUR_ARRAY < S > , it can also read from std :: vector < YOUR_ARRAY < S >> , etc. extending nested array access Extending Suppose you have an in-house nested array type whose elements cannot be accessed by any strategy in the hierarchy above. You can define a custom function that converts your arrays to a std :: vector < std :: vector < S >> like std :: vector < std :: vector < S >> adaptorF_custom_convertNestedArrayToStdVector ( const YOUR_NESTED_ARRAY & inputData ) { The array adaptors will pick up this function and use it to access your type. Example: // A nested list type with unusual access struct UserNestedListCustom { std :: list < std :: vector < int >> vals ; size_t size () const { return vals . size (); } }; std :: vector < std :: vector < int >> adaptorF_custom_convertNestedArrayToStdVector ( const UserNestedListCustom & inputData ) { std :: vector < std :: vector < int >> out ; for ( auto v : inputData . vals ) { std :: vector < int > inner ; for ( auto x : v ) { inner . push_back ( x ); } out . push_back ( inner ); } return out ; } Debugging One downside to our \u201cclever\u201d use of templates is that compiler error messages can be borderline incomprehensible. Generally, the best debugging strategy is to carefully read the documentation and ensure you are passing in data that makes sense. In most cases, the problem is something simple, like passing a 3D vector where a 2D vector is needed, or mixing up the order of arguments. However, if you are deep in the weeds trying to debug why your type isn\u2019t matching against the template hierarchy (or why a custom function isn\u2019t being used), consider adding the define #define POLYSCOPE_NO_STANDARDIZE_FALLTHROUGH anywhere before the Polyscope includes. This will cause most compilers to print the long scary list of all template substitutions which were considered and rejected, which you can slowly parse to aid you on your quest.","title":"Data Adaptors"},{"location":"data_adaptors/#fixed-size-vector-types","text":"These are 2D or 3D vectors whose size are known at compile time, commonly used to represent things like positions (3D), or UV coordinates (2D).

These values can generally be manually adjusted in the GUI, or set programmatically in code. This page documents special features in Polyscope which provide extra functionality while setting these parameters. Persistent values In Polyscope, if you manually set the color of points in a point cloud, then register a new point cloud with the same name overwriting the original, the new point cloud will inherit the old point cloud\u2019s color. This functionality, and other similar behavior, is implemented via persistent values . Persistent values are lightweight wrappers around a variable which on-construction look up the variable\u2019s in a global cache, and if a cache entry exists take the cached value instead. Any time the variable is written to, its value is recorded in the global cache. Generally, the cache key includes the name of a structure (and quantity if applicable), so a cached variable will only be picked up when names match. Generally, the user should not manually interact with persistent values ever, all you need to know is that some variables may \u201cmagically\u201d remember their old values by pulling them from a cache. PointCloud * psCloud = polyscope :: getPointCloud ( \"my cloud\" ); psCloud -> setPointColor ( glm :: vec3 ( 0.5 , 0.5 , 0.5 )); // the persistent value is recorded in the cache // ... later ... PointCloud * newCloud = polyscope :: registerPointCloud ( \"my cloud\" , new_points ); // newCloud will automatically pick up the pointColor we set above, // since this point cloud has the same name Note that this persistence behavior applies even when variables are manually manipulated in the GUI. for implementors If writing custom Polyscope library code (e.g. your own custom structures and quantities), here\u2019s what you need to know to use persistent values. The class PersistentValue < T > is templated on the underlying scalar type, like PersistentValue < double > . Only a predefined set of types can be used as template arguments because the corresponding global cache must be allocated. See persistent_value . h for a listing, which currently includes bool , float , double , ScaledValue < float > , ScaledValue < double > , glm :: vec3 , and gl :: ColorMapID . Construct a persistent value like PersistentValue < float > myVar ( \"unique_name\" , 0.5 ) the variable will the cached value if one exists, and if not take the value 0 . 5 (and add it to the cache). Remember to use a globally unique name for the for the name argument; in structures you can use a concatenation of the type name, structure name, and (if applicable) quantity name. To access a persistent value, call myVar . get () , which returns a reference to the underlying value. In some occasions, in particular when using ImGui, you may need to write to a value directly via the pointer from & myVar . get () . This is problematic, because the variable does not know it has been written to and thus needs to update the cache. The function myVar . manuallyUpdated () can be called to notify the persistent value that it needs to update the cache. The paradigm for using a persistent value with ImGui then looks like if ( ImGui :: SliderFloat ( \"some text\" , & myVar . get ())) { myVar . manuallyChanged (); } Scaled values Specifying appearance (such as the radius of points in a point cloud) in global length units can be inconvenient; its generally much easier to set values relatively, which respect to some reasonable length scale. The ScaledValue type tracks such represents such values, if we set ScaledValue s = 7 . , then s . asAbsolute () will return 7 . * state :: lengthScale when used. Most length-valued parameters in Polyscope use this mechanism, and thus are relative by default. using namespace polyscope ; PointCloud * psCloud = polyscope :: getPointCloud ( \"my cloud\" ); // radius will be 0.05 * lengthScale when used psCloud -> pointRadius = ScaledValue < double >:: relative ( 0.05 ); psCloud -> pointRadius = relativeValue ( 0.05 ); // shorthand, same as previous psCloud -> pointRadius = 0.05 ; // shorthand, same as previous However, sometimes you might want to actually use an absolute value for a parameter, for instance to get exactly the same appearance between runs of a program on different data. To support that, scaled values can optionally be set as absolute values, which will not be scaled before use. // radius will be 1.6 when used psCloud -> pointRadius = ScaledValue < double >:: absolute ( 1.6 ) psCloud -> pointRadius = absoluteValue ( 1.6 ); // shorthand, same as previous Note that scaled values can be (and often are) used as persistent values , as described above; the two concepts are complementary. for implementors If writing custom Polyscope library code (e.g. your own custom structures and quantities), here\u2019s what you need to know to use scaled values.

The first step in seeing your data in Polyscope is to register one or more structures to add them to the visualization. Then, quantities can be added to these structures, like scalar functions, colors, or vector fields. Each structure should be given a name which is unique among structures of that type. You can then use this name as a handle to perform operations on the structure; For instance, you can register a mesh with: polyscope :: registerSurfaceMesh ( \"my mesh\" , vertices , faces ); Then, in a distant part of your code, add a scalar function to it with: polyscope :: getSurfaceMesh ( \"my mesh\" ) -> addScalarQuantity ( \"some values\" , values ); This avoids the need to pass a pointer to the structure you created around your entire codebase. Memory management As a general policy, Polyscope always manages its own memory, and will take care of deleting anything it allocated. Whenever a routine returns a pointer (like getStructure () ), it is a non-owning pointer. You should never delete one of these pointers. To delete a structure and free memory, see the removeStructure () methods below. The following structures available in Polyscope. Many more structures are in development! Surface Mesh Point Cloud Curve Network in progress : Camera View in progress : Tet Mesh Registering structures Each structure offers a register___ ( name , ...) function (like registerPointCloud () ) which accepts the name of the structure and the data necessary to construct it. These functions will return a Structure * pointer which may be used to add quantities to the structure. See the relevant sections for documentation on each of these register functions. By default, these functions will error-out if a structure with that name is already in use. However, they take an optional boolean argument allowReplacement argument, which can be set to true to replace an existing structure of the same name. The general form for registering structures is below; it may be useful if you are implementing your own structures. bool registerStructure ( Structure * structure , bool replaceIfPresent = true ) Register a new structure with Polyscope. The structure must have a Structure :: name which is unique amongst all registered structures of that type. Polyscope takes ownership of the memory when the structure is registered, and will delete it when no longer needed. Note: most users will create structures via the individual registerPointCloud () (etc) functions, rather than this general form. Accessing structures Polyscope offers two patterns for calling methods on a registered structure: you can either use the pointer returned after structure creation, or refer to the structure by name. #include \"polyscope/surface_mesh.h\" // register a structure polyscope :: SurfaceMesh * psMesh = polyscope :: registerSurfaceMesh ( \"my mesh\" , vertices , faces ); // with the pointer psMesh -> addScalarQuantity ( \"some values\" , values ); // by name polyscope :: getSurfaceMesh ( \"my mesh\" ) -> addScalarQuantity ( \"some values\" , values ); The former is concise and programmatic, while the latter avoids the need to keep track of a variable. As before, each structure offers a get___ ( name ) method, like getSurfaceMesh ( name ) which can be used to get pointer to a structure of that type by name. The general form below may be useful if you are implementing your own structures. Structure * getStructure ( std :: string type , std :: string name = \"\" ) Get a pointer to a registered structure. The type must be the unique string corresponding to the structure type. As a convenience, if the name may be argument omitted only if there is exactly one structure of that type. If not such structure is available, nullptr will be returned. Note: most users will get structures via the individual getPointCloud () (etc) functions, rather than this general form. Removing structures If no longer needed, structures can be removed by name or by pointer. Removing a structure frees memory for the underlying objects, invalidating all references to the structure and its quantities. void removeStructure ( Structure * structure , bool errorIfAbsent = true ) Remove the specified structure and free objects associated with it. If errorIfAbsent == true , and error will be thrown if there is no such structure registered, otherwise the function will return silently. void removeStructure ( std :: string type , std :: string name , bool errorIfAbsent = true ) Identical to removeStructure ( Struture * ) , but accepts a type name and name instead. void removeStructure ( std :: string name , bool errorIfAbsent = true ) Identical to removeStructure ( Struture * ) , but accepts a name instead.

Then, quantities can be added to these structures, like scalar functions, colors, or vector fields. Each structure should be given a name which is unique among structures of that type. You can then use this name as a handle to perform operations on the structure; For instance, you can register a mesh with: polyscope :: registerSurfaceMesh ( \"my mesh\" , vertices , faces ); Then, in a distant part of your code, add a scalar function to it with: polyscope :: getSurfaceMesh ( \"my mesh\" ) -> addScalarQuantity ( \"some values\" , values ); This avoids the need to pass a pointer to the structure you created around your entire codebase. Memory management As a general policy, Polyscope always manages its own memory, and will take care of deleting anything it allocated. Whenever a routine returns a pointer (like getStructure () ), it is a non-owning pointer. You should never delete one of these pointers. To delete a structure and free memory, see the removeStructure () methods below. The following structures available in Polyscope. Many more structures are in development!

These functions will return a Structure * pointer which may be used to add quantities to the structure. See the relevant sections for documentation on each of these register functions. By default, these functions will error-out if a structure with that name is already in use. However, they take an optional boolean argument allowReplacement argument, which can be set to true to replace an existing structure of the same name. The general form for registering structures is below; it may be useful if you are implementing your own structures. bool registerStructure ( Structure * structure , bool replaceIfPresent = true ) Register a new structure with Polyscope. The structure must have a Structure :: name which is unique amongst all registered structures of that type. Polyscope takes ownership of the memory when the structure is registered, and will delete it when no longer needed.

As before, each structure offers a get___ ( name ) method, like getSurfaceMesh ( name ) which can be used to get pointer to a structure of that type by name. The general form below may be useful if you are implementing your own structures. Structure * getStructure ( std :: string type , std :: string name = \"\" ) Get a pointer to a registered structure. The type must be the unique string corresponding to the structure type. As a convenience, if the name may be argument omitted only if there is exactly one structure of that type.

Unfortunately, not everyone can agree on how to order the elements of their meshes\u2014which edge is the i^\\textrm{th} i^\\textrm{th} edge in a mesh? Polyscope defines a default ordering of mesh elements. If you happen to use the same ordering, everything will \u201cjust work\u201d (this is probably the case for quantities defined on vertices and faces), you can simply call the relevant functions as you see in the tutorials and examples. However, if you happen to a different convention for ordering some mesh element (say, edges), visualizations of data on edges will not work correctly out of the box\u2014your data arrays will be associated with the wrong mesh elements. This section describes the remedy: you can give the mesh a permutation, which will be used to translate from the indexing conventions of your data to the indexing conventions of Polyscope. In general, this permutation p should be an array of integers, such that if i is the i^\\textrm{th} i^\\textrm{th} element in the default ordering, p [ i ] gives the index under your convention. Your data arrays will then be indexed as data [ p [ i ]] when passed as arguments to surface mesh visualization functions. In fact, your indexing convention need not even have the same number of elements as the Polyscope convention, so long as data [ p [ i ]] is always a valid access; if the size of your index space is different, a size can also be passed in. The sections below define the default ordering of mesh elements, and show how to set an alternate permutation for each if the default ordering does not match your ordering. Vertices The first argument when registering a surface mesh with Polyscope is a list of vertex positions. The ordering of vertices in this list is the default ordering vertices. Arrays of vertex-valued data passed for visualization will be interpted in that order, unless an alternate permutation is set as below. SurfaceMesh :: setVertexPermutation ( const T & permArr , size_t expectedSize = 0 ) Set a non-standard ordering for vertex-valued data on a mesh. The argument should be an array-like type which can be interpreted as an array integers, see input adaptors . One good choice is a std :: vector < size_t > . If the size of your index space is different from size of the default index space, the optional second argument must give this new size. If not given, the size will be inferred from the largest entry in permArr . Must be set before any quantites are added. Faces The second argument when registering a surface mesh with Polyscope is a list of face indices. The ordering of faces in this list is the default ordering faces. Arrays of face-valued data passed for visualization will be interpted in that order, unless an alternate permutation is set as below. SurfaceMesh :: setFacePermutation ( const T & permArr , size_t expectedSize = 0 ) Set a non-standard ordering for face-valued data on a mesh. The argument should be an array-like type which can be interpreted as an array integers, see input adaptors . One good choice is a std :: vector < size_t > . If the size of your index space is different from size of the default index space, the optional second argument must give this new size. If not given, the size will be inferred from the largest entry in permArr . Must be set before any quantites are added. Edges The second argument when registering a surface mesh with Polyscope is a list of face indices. The edge ordering is defined from this list by the first time an edge appears in any face. More formally, the ordering is equivalent to the following code: std :: vector < std :: vector < size_t >> faceIndices ; for ( std :: vector < size_t > face : faceIndices ) { size_t faceDegree = face . size (); for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < faceDegree ; i ++ ) { size_t vertex_A = face [ i ]; size_t vertex_B = face [ ( i + 1 ) % faceDegree ]; // emit edge (vertex_A, vertex_B), if neither it nor the // equivalent edge (vertex_B, vertex_A) has been emitted already } } The default ordering of edges is the order in which they would be emitted by this loop. Arrays of edge-valued data passed for visualization will be interpted in that order, unless an alternate permutation is set as below. SurfaceMesh :: setEdgePermutation ( const T & permArr , size_t expectedSize = 0 ) Set a non-standard ordering for edge-valued data on a mesh. The argument should be an array-like type which can be interpreted as an array integers, see input adaptors . One good choice is a std :: vector < size_t > . If the size of your index space is different from size of the default index space, the optional second argument must give this new size. If not given, the size will be inferred from the largest entry in permArr . Must be set before any quantites are added. Halfedges The second argument when registering a surface mesh with Polyscope is a list of face indices. The halfedge ordering is defined from this list by first ordering by the faces, then ordering by the halfedges within each face. More formally, the ordering is equivalent to the following code: std :: vector < std :: vector < size_t >> faceIndices ; for ( std :: vector < size_t > face : faceIndices ) { size_t faceDegree = face . size (); for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < faceDegree ; i ++ ) { size_t vertex_A = face [ i ]; size_t vertex_B = face [ ( i + 1 ) % faceDegree ]; // emit halfedge (vertex_A, vertex_B) } } The default ordering of halfedges is the order in which they would be emitted by this loop. Arrays of halfedge-valued data passed for visualization will be interpted in that order, unless an alternate permutation is set as below. SurfaceMesh :: setHalfedgePermutation ( const T & permArr , size_t expectedSize = 0 ) Set a non-standard ordering for halfedge-valued data on a mesh.

If the size of your index space is different from size of the default index space, the optional second argument must give this new size. If not given, the size will be inferred from the largest entry in permArr . Must be set before any quantites are added. Corners The second argument when registering a surface mesh with Polyscope is a list of face indices. The corner ordering is defined from this list by first ordering by the faces, then ordering by the corners within each face. More formally, the ordering is equivalent to the following code: std :: vector < std :: vector < size_t >> faceIndices ; for ( std :: vector < size_t > face : faceIndices ) { size_t faceDegree = face . size (); for ( size_t i = 0 ; i < faceDegree ; i ++ ) { size_t vertex_A = face [ i ]; // emit corner in this face incident on vertex_A } } The default ordering of corners is the order in which they would be emitted by this loop. Arrays of corner-valued data passed for visualization will be interpted in that order, unless an alternate permutation is set as below. SurfaceMesh :: setCornerPermutation ( const T & permArr , size_t expectedSize = 0 ) Set a non-standard ordering for corner-valued data on a mesh. The argument should be an array-like type which can be interpreted as an array integers, see input adaptors . One good choice is a std :: vector < size_t > . If the size of your index space is different from size of the default index space, the optional second argument must give this new size. If not given, the size will be inferred from the largest entry in permArr . Must be set before any quantites are added. All at once As a convenience, you can alternately define a single function which passes all permutations needed at the same time. This is useful because you can write a single helper function which defines any necessary permutations for the mesh convention in your codebase; see the geometry-central integration for an example. The permutations should be passed as a std :: array < std :: pair < T , size_t > , 5 > , where T is any type that could be used in the set___Permutation () functions above\u2014one good choice is a std :: array < std :: pair < std :: vector < size_t > , size_t > , 5 > . Each entry of this array is one of the permutations listed above: [vertices, faces, edges, halfedges, corners]. Any permutations which have size () == 0 will be untouched. The second entry of the pair is the optional size of the target index space, as in expectedSize above. These permutations can either be set with SurfaceMesh :: setAllPermutations () , or at construction time via a third argument to registerSurfaceMesh () . SurfaceMesh :: setAllPermutations ( const std :: array < std :: pair < T , size_t > , 5 >& perms ) Set all of the ordering permutations at once, as described above. The argument should be a std :: array <> of an array-like type which can be interpreted as an array integers, see input adaptors . One good choice is a std :: array < std :: pair < std :: vector < size_t > , size_t > , 5 > . If the size of your index space is different from size of the default index space, the second component of each pair must give this new size. Otherwise, the second component of the pair may be set to zero, to infer the size of the index space from the maximum index given. Must be set before any quantites are added. SurfaceMesh * polyscope :: registerSurfaceMesh ( std :: string name , const V & vertexPositions , const F & faceIndices , const std :: array < std :: pair < P , size_t > , 5 >& perms , bool replaceIfPresent = true ) Register a mesh and immediately set all custom permutations, as described above.

This input is an array of booleans at edges. The type should be adaptable to an array of char s (because std :: vector < bool > is broken). The length should be the number of edges in the mesh. These booleans should be true if the edge points from the lower indexed adjacent vertex to the higher-indexed vertex, and false otherwise. Remember, before passing edge-valued data, be sure your indexing convention matches what Polyscope expects.","title":"One forms"},{"location":"structures/surface_mesh/vector_quantities/#options","text":"Parameter Meaning Getter Setter Persistent? enabled is the quantity enabled? bool isEnabled () setEnabled ( bool newVal ) yes vector radius the radius vectors are drawn with double getVectorRadius () setVectorRadius ( double val , bool isRelative = true ) yes vector length vectors will be scaled so the longest is this long. ignored if VectorType :: Ambient double getVectorLengthScale () setVectorLengthScale ( double val , bool isRelative = true ) yes vector color the color to draw the vectors with glm :: vec3 getVectorColor () setVectorColor ( glm :: vec3 val ) yes ribbon enabled draw the ribbon visualization (only available for intrinsic vector fields) bool isRibbonEnabled () setRibbonEnabled ( bool newVal ) yes (all setters return this to support chaining. setEnabled() returns generic quantity, so chain it last)","title":"Options"}]}
